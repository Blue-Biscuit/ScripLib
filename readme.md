            <h2>What is ScripLib?</h2>
            <p>
                <em>ScripMem</em> is a simple, lightweight C++ library intended
                to be implemented in apps which aid the user in the
                usage of Scripture. To this end, ScripMem provides
                a few classes to deal with Scripture references, passages,
                and books. Ideally, ScripLib can also be configured to use
                whatever API is intended for use in your application.

        <div id="why">
            <h2>Why use ScripLib?</h2>
            <p>
                ScripLib is focused on simplicity for the end user, so that
                the one implementing ScripLib need only focus himself upon
                application design, rather than the subtleties of user input
                and converting between reference systems. Furthermore,
                as ScripLib is implemented in the practically universal C++
                language, there is most certainly a means to implement it
                in whatever project you may desire.
